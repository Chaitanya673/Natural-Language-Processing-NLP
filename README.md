# 1. Introduction to Text Mining 
Text Mining is the process of deriving useful information from text.

### What is Text Mining?
* Text mining /Text Analytics is the process of driving meaningful information from natural language text.
* As, Text mining refers to process of driving high quality information from the text.
* Text mining is defined as the process of analysing text to pull out the relevant information for specific purpose.
* Text Mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text, driving pattern within the structured data, and finally evaluating and interpreting the output.


# 2. Introduction to NLP
NLP is a branch of data science that consists of systematic processes for analyzing, understanding, and deriving information from the text data in a smart and efficient manner. 

By utilizing NLP and its components, one can organize the massive chunks of text data, perform numerous automated tasks and solve a wide range of problems such as – automatic summarization, machine translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation etc.

### Natural Language Processing Applications
Here’s a list of real-world applications that make use of NLP techniques:
* **Sentimental Analysis:** By implementing NLP Tech giants such as Amazon and Netflix, gain insights on their customers to enhance their products and make better recommendations.
* **Chatbot:** Chatbots are becoming popular in the field of customer service. A popular example is Eva the HDFC chatbot who has addressed over 3 million customer queries, interacted with over half a million unique users, and held over a million conversations.
* **Speech Recognition:** NLP has been used widely in speech recognition, we’re all aware of Alexa, Siri, Google assistant, and Cortana. They’re all applications of NLP.
* **Machine Translation:** The popular Google translator uses Natural Language Processing to process and translate one language to the other. It is also used in spell checkers, keyword search, information extraction.
* **Advertisement Matching:** NLP is also used in advertisement matching to recommend ads based on search history.
